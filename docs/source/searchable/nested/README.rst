Nested

The nested type is a specialised version of the object data type that allows arrays of objects to be indexed in a way that they can be queried independently of each other.

.. literalinclude:: mapping.php
   :language: php
   :linenos:

.. literalinclude:: saving.php
   :language: php
   :linenos:
